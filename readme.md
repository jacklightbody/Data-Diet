# Data Diet
Data Diet is a simple content blocker app for iOS aimed at international travellers. It lets you selectively block resources so that you don't use up all of your cellular data loading unwanted images and videos.

## Installation
Download a zip of the project and open up the .xcodeproj file in Xcode. Connect your iPhone to your computer. In the list of simulators select the iPhone at top, and click the triangle run button in the top left. You will likely have to enter your passcode on your device, and then trust the app by going into Settings -> General -> Developer and allowing apps from jhlightbody to run on the device.

## Usage
When you open up the app it automatically detects whether you are on wifi or data. If you are on data, then it blocks certain resources from loading in Safari, conserving your precious data. You can specifiy which resources not to block by turning their switches off in the app. Once you are on wifi again simply open up the app, and then all resources will be loaded in subsequent safari requests.
